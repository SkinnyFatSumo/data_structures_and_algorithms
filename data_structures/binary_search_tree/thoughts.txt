BINARY SEARCH TREES
(aka Ordered Binary Trees or Sorted Binary Trees)

How is it unique?
  - keys are always kept in SORTED order


Pros:
  - fast lookup
  - fast addition
  - fast removal

Cons:
  - not as fast as a hash table


Properties:
  - makes decision at each node between left and right subtree
    - allows it to skip about 1/2 the tree
    - O log N (proportional to number of items in the tree) for:
      - access
      - search
      - insertion
      - deletion


Use Cases:
  - implement dynamic sets of items
  - use as a lookup table, finding items by key:
    - like finding a person's phone number by name
